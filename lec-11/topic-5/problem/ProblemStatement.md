# Title: Enhanced Error Handling Middleware for E-commerce Node.js Project

# Introduction + Scenario:

In an e-commerce Node.js project, develop an advanced error handling middleware, 'src/middlewares/errorHandler.js,' vital for maintaining a robust user experience. This middleware, integrated into the index file, must adeptly manage errors arising from various operations within the dynamic e-commerce environment. It should ensure that client responses contain precise user-defined error codes and messages, while unhandled errors must trigger a "500 Internal Server Error" with the message 'oops! something went wrong...Try again later!'

# Objectives:

Implement the 'src/middlewares/errorHandler.js' middleware to effectively capture application-level errors.

Seamlessly integrate the middleware into the index file to oversee error management during all operations.

Skillfully communicate with clients by providing appropriate HTTP status codes along with informative error messages.

# Notes/Hints:

Rigorously test the middleware with diverse error scenarios.
