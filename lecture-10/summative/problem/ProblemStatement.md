# Title: Employee Management API Integration

# Introduction + Scenario:

In this coding problem, you are tasked with resolving an issue in the backend of an employee management application. Your friend, who is working on the frontend part, needs to fetch a list of employees from the API "http://localhost:4000/api/v1/emp" and display it on the HTML page. However, there seems to be an issue in the backend code that prevents the frontend from displaying the employee list correctly. Your objective is to fix the backend code and implement the "fetchEmpData" function in "frontend/index.js" for rendering the employee list.

# Objectives:

Fix the backend code to resolve the issue with the employee list API.
Implement the "fetchEmpData" function in the frontend inside 'index.js' to fetch and render the list of employees.

# Expected Output:

Upon successful completion, the frontend HTML page should display a list of employees fetched from the backend API "http://localhost:4000/api/v1/emp".
